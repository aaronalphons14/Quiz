##How the Quiz App Works

#Intro Page

When the user opens the app, they land on the intro page.

The page displays the logo and a “Enter” button.

Clicking Enter takes the user to the main quiz page (can be linked to your main Quiz repository or component).

#Quiz Page

The user sees 10 general knowledge questions (or as configured).

Each question has multiple-choice answers.

Only one option can be selected per question.

#Answer Selection

When the user selects an answer, it is recorded locally.

The app can provide instant feedback (correct/wrong) if implemented.

#Navigation

Users can navigate question by question or all at once depending on design.

The app keeps track of which question is active.

#Scoring

After the user finishes all questions, the app calculates the score.

The result summary shows how many answers were correct, providing instant feedback.

#Responsive Design

The app layout adapts to desktop and mobile screens.

Screenshots show how it looks on different devices.

#Tech Behind It

React manages the UI and interactive elements.

TypeScript ensures type safety in state management (like selected answers).

Vite handles fast builds and hot-reloading for development.

Tailwind CSS styles the pages cleanly and responsively.

💡 In short:

User opens intro → clicks Enter → answers questions → sees score.

The app is lightweight, responsive, and easy to extend with more questions or categories.
